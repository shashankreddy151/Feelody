# Netlify Deployment Guide for Mood Music Player

## Build Issues Fixed ✅

This project had several build issues that have been resolved:

### 1. Node.js Version Compatibility
- **Issue**: `@solana/codecs-core` requires Node.js >=20.18.0, but Netlify was using v18.20.8
- **Fix**: Updated netlify.toml to use Node.js 20.18.0 and added .nvmrc for local development

### 2. ESLint Warnings as Errors
- **Issue**: CI environment treats ESLint warnings as errors
- **Fix**: Set `CI=false` in build script and fixed all ESLint warnings

### 2. Missing Environment Variables
- **Issue**: Last.fm API key not configured
- **Fix**: Added fallback handling and created `.env.example`

### 3. Webpack Configuration Issues
- **Issue**: Node.js polyfills causing build failures
- **Fix**: Improved `config-overrides.js` with proper polyfills

### 4. Missing Build Configuration
- **Issue**: No Netlify-specific configuration
- **Fix**: Added `netlify.toml` with proper headers and redirects

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these environment variables in your Netlify dashboard:

```bash
REACT_APP_LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key_here
```

**How to get Last.fm API key:**
1. Go to https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
2. Create an application
3. Copy the API key

### 2. Build Settings in Netlify
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `build`
- **Node version**: `20.18.0` (set in netlify.toml - **CRITICAL FOR BUILD SUCCESS**)

### 3. Deploy
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set the environment variables in Netlify dashboard
3. Deploy!

## Build Commands

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test build locally
npm run build

# Verify build
npm run build:check

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Troubleshooting

#### If build fails with "CI=true" errors:
The build script now uses `CI=false` to treat warnings as warnings, not errors.

#### If API features don't work:
Make sure `REACT_APP_LASTFM_API_KEY` is set in Netlify environment variables.

#### If audio streaming fails:
The app uses Audius for streaming, which should work without additional configuration.
